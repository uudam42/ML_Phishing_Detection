# 1 Data Import and Initial Inspection

```{r
# Connect to SQLite database
 db_path <- "data/phishing_email.sqlite"
 con     <- connect_to_db(db_path)

# Read the 'emails' table
 emails <- dbReadTable(con, "emails")

# Display the first few rows
 head(emails)

# Disconnect from the database
 dbDisconnect(con)
```

# 2 Exploratory SQL Queries

```{r
# Reconnect to the database
con <- connect_to_db(db_path)

# Query total emails and number of phishing emails
total_count <- dbGetQuery(con, "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_emails,
    SUM(label) AS spam_emails
  FROM emails;")
print(total_count)

# Count emails containing the keyword 'xls'
xls_count <- dbGetQuery(con, "
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN text_combined LIKE '%xls%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS xls_count
  FROM emails;")
print(xls_count)

# Disconnect from the database
 dbDisconnect(con)
```

# 3 Feature Engineering

```{r
# Load feature dataset
features <- read_csv("data/features.csv")

# Show a preview of the features
head(features)
```

# 4 Model Training and Evaluation

```{r
# Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets
set.seed(123)
idx      <- createDataPartition(features$label, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_df <- features[idx, ]
test_df  <- features[-idx, ]

# Train logistic regression model with probability predictions enabled
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "none", classProbs = TRUE)
model <- train(
  label ~ . - id,
  data      = train_df,
  method    = "glm",
  family    = binomial(),
  trControl = ctrl
)

# Print model summary
print(model)

# Predict probabilities and classes on the test set
probs <- predict(model, test_df, type = "prob")[, "spam"]
preds <- factor(ifelse(probs > 0.5, "spam", "ham"), levels = c("ham", "spam"))

# Compute and display the confusion matrix
cm <- confusionMatrix(preds, test_df$label, positive = "spam")
print(cm)

# Compute and display ROC AUC
roc_obj <- roc(test_df$label, probs, levels = c("ham", "spam"))
auc_val <- auc(roc_obj)
cat("Test ROC AUC:", round(auc_val, 3), "\n")
```

# 5 Visualization

```{r
# Prepare ROC curve data frame
roc_df <- data.frame(
  FPR = 1 - roc_obj$specificities,
  TPR = roc_obj$sensitivities
)

# Plot ROC curve
ggplot(roc_df, aes(x = FPR, y = TPR)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_abline(linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "ROC Curve",
    x     = "False Positive Rate (FPR)",
    y     = "True Positive Rate (TPR)"
  )
```

```{r
# Prepare confusion matrix for heatmap
cm_df <- as.data.frame(cm$table)

# Plot confusion matrix heatmap
ggplot(cm_df, aes(x = Reference, y = Prediction, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), color = "white", size = 6) +
  labs(
    title = "Confusion Matrix Heatmap",
    x     = "Actual Label",
    y     = "Predicted Label"
  )
```

# 6 Conclusions and Next Steps

In this analysis, the logistic regression model achieved on the test set:

- **Accuracy**: `r round(cm$overall["Accuracy"], 3)`
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: `r round(cm$byClass["Sensitivity"], 3)`
- **Specificity**: `r round(cm$byClass["Specificity"], 3)`
- **ROC AUC**: `r round(auc_val, 3)`

> **Summary**: The model successfully identifies the majority of phishing emails but has a high false positive rate. Future improvements could include threshold optimization, additional text/metadata features, or using advanced algorithms such as Random Forest or XGBoost.

# 7 Practical Implications

This project demonstrates a reproducible end-to-end workflow, offering:

1. **Automated Threat Detection**: Can be integrated into email servers or security platforms for real-time phishing detection.
2. **Extensible Feature Set**: Modular feature extraction allows quick addition of URL analysis, attachment metadata, or advanced NLP features.
3. **Reproducible Deployment**: Lightweight R scripts and SQLite make it easy to containerize (e.g., using Docker) and automate via CI/CD.
4. **Insightful Reporting**: Generates self-contained HTML/PDF reports for stakeholders to review model performance and improvement strategies.

These components form a solid foundation for enterprise email security solutions.
